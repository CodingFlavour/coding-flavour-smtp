### Programmatically

This library exposes several functions for sending emails. The available functions are detailed below:
- `TEMPLATES`: An object that contains the available email templates. Each template has a name and an associated function that generates the content of the email.
- `getCodingFlavourEmail`: A function that returns the Coding Flavour email address, used for sending emails.
- `SendGrid`: An object that contains the configuration and functions necessary to send emails through SendGrid.
  - `sendEmail`: A function that takes an email object and sends it through SendGrid.
